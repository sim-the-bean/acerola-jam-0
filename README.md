# The Aberratron

## Tips

- There's 5 collectibles which outline the backstory of the game
- There's 5 achievements
    - 4 are hidden and might require you to do things you wouldn't do normally
    - 1 is related to collecting all collectibles

## Which graphics settings to use?
There's 3 graphics presets available, on my laptop with a 1660 TI the highest one runs at a smooth 90-100fps.  
There isn't a big visual difference between 2 and 3 but a significant difference in performance.  
The lowest setting uses significantly less VRAM and performs much better, but also looks worse.
